# moodle-ranking

What is it?
This is a plugin for Moodle, that allows Student Grades in courses to be viewed in a rank model, and to display there ranks and each individual rankings with the corresponding grades. You can also customize the way to view the ranking same as the default grades for moodle, and with the ability to search, sort and filter functionality.

Credits
The original grade plugin was by Moodle and I have modified the source to obtain the ranking(quiz_grade) format in Moodle 3.1.

Contribute
Fork the plugin, fix a bug or add a new feature, and send a pull-request. Or, if you're not a developer, but you've found a bug, add a issue tracker.

Deployment:
Move htdocs individual files into fresh moodle dir root.
*But for ease of use, you can simply use the quiz_grade folder only
